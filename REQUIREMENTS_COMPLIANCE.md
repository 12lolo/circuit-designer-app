## Deviations from Original Requirements

### Positive Deviations (Enhancements)

1. **Grid Size**: Originally 30x30, implemented as 15x15 with 1-cell border
   - **Rationale**: Better screen utilization, cleaner layout
   - **Impact**: No negative impact, easier to work with

2. **Component Naming**: Enhanced with LED-specific naming
   - **Original**: Only Resistor, Voltage_source, Ground
   - **Implemented**: Also LED(unique number), Switch(unique number)
   - **Impact**: Consistent naming for all components

3. **Connection Points**: Enhanced visualization
   - **Original**: Red dots (green on hover)
   - **Implemented**: Red dots (green on hover) + validation
   - **Impact**: Prevents invalid connections (out→out, self-connect)

4. **Wire System**: Major enhancement beyond requirements
   - **Original**: Simple straight wires
   - **Implemented**: Wires with bend points, routing
   - **Impact**: Professional-looking circuits, better organization

### Intentional Omissions

1. **AC Voltage Source**: Listed as "Could Have"
   - **Status**: Not implemented
   - **Rationale**: DC analysis is sufficient for v1.0, AC requires complex analysis

2. **Online Hosting**: Listed as "Could Have"
   - **Status**: Not implemented
   - **Rationale**: Focus on desktop application stability first

3. **30x30 Grid**: Changed to 15x15 + border
   - **Status**: Reduced size
   - **Rationale**: Better screen fit, more usable space

## Gaps & Recommendations

### Minor Gaps (Low Priority)

1. **UC07-TC03: Corrupted File Handling**
   - **Current**: Generic error on invalid JSON
   - **Required**: Clear, specific error message
   - **Recommendation**: Add try-catch in `project_manager.py:load_project()` with user-friendly message
   - **Effort**: 1 hour

2. **Simulation Performance Test**
   - **Current**: No stress test data
   - **Required**: Test with 100+ components
   - **Recommendation**: Create test circuit with 100+ components, measure simulation time
   - **Effort**: 2 hours

3. **Application Deployment**
   - **Current**: Runs from source code
   - **Required**: .exe file delivery (per technical design)
   - **Recommendation**: Use PyInstaller to create standalone executable
   - **Effort**: 4 hours (includes testing)

### Documentation Improvements

1. **Test Report**
   - **Current**: Test scenarios checklist exists
   - **Missing**: Formal test report with results
   - **Recommendation**: Run all pending tests, document results
   - **Effort**: 8 hours

2. **User Manual**
   - **Current**: README with quick start
   - **Missing**: Comprehensive user manual (not required, but nice to have)
   - **Recommendation**: Optional enhancement for future version
   - **Effort**: 16 hours
